# Education-Futures-Studio
Welcome to the Education Futures Studio: a space that manifests through shared ideas, practices, and tools. Our main aim at the EFS is to make technical democracy (a Science and Technology Studies idea created by Michael Callon and colleagues) a defining feature of education futures. This means, we try to find ways to collectively learn about, experiment with, and democratize contemporary technologies of governance in education. At the EFS, we work with diverse, cross-sectoral stakeholders to understand socio-technical controversies in education. We advance interdisciplinary collaborations across the humanities, social sciences and computer sciences that explore links between education, emerging technologies (such as Artificial Intelligence), policy, learning, and research.
